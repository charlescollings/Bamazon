# Bamazon

## Bamazon is a ficticious online retailer. 
In this "Bamazon" app the user can choose to bid on a list of items for sale.

The list of items for sale (inventory) and the items' attributes are kept in a SQL database.

When a user successfully purcahses items, the inventory table in SQL is updated to reflect items being removed from inventory.

**Below you can see the flow of the app. Note how the stock_quantity for HALO changes from 31 to 28 after the user makes the purchase.**
